# Card Matching Game Example

### Summary

This is a simple, responsive, and smooth card-matching game built from scratch using **Unity 2021.3.45f1**, with no third-party frameworks or purchased assets. The project supports both PC and mobile platforms and uses Unity's **New Input System** for input handling.

The game includes a basic **menu** with `Start` and `Load` buttons. If the user had previously started a game, they can continue from where they left off using the load feature. Gameplay is fluid â€” players can flip cards continuously without waiting for the match result of the previous pair, allowing for fast-paced interaction. All animations, card layout systems, save/load mechanisms, and effects were implemented using native C# and Unity features.

## ðŸ”§ Project Setup

- **Engine**: Unity 2021.3.45f1 LTS  
- **Platform**: Desktop (PC/Mac) + Mobile (Android/iOS)  
- **Input**: Unity New Input System  
- **No external assets or frameworks used**

## âœ… Feature Checklist (Based on Requirements)

### 1. Develop from Scratch  
âœ” Built entirely from scratch using Unity 2021.3.45f1 â€” no third-party or purchased assets were used.

### 2. Smooth Gameplay with Card Flip Animations  
âœ” Flip animations are smooth and handled with scale-based animation.  
âœ” Users are allowed to continue flipping cards without waiting for the previous match animation or comparison to complete.

### 3. Dynamic Card Layouts (2x2, 2x3, 5x6, etc.)  
âœ” Implemented using a flexible layout system inside `CardManager`.  
âœ” Cards dynamically scale and reposition themselves based on the screen size and camera position.

### 4. Save/Load System  
âœ” Implemented a modular save system using `SaveLoadManager` and `PlayerPrefSaveLoadDal` (Data Access Layer).  
âœ” Allows future switching to cloud saves by simply swapping the DAL instance, keeping the core game logic untouched.

### 5. Scoring System  
âœ” Score increases upon correct matches.  
âœ” A combo system rewards players with bonus points for consecutive successful matches.

### 6. Sound Effects  
âœ” Integrated basic sound effects for:
- Card flipping  
- Successful match  
- Mismatch  
- Game over  

### 7. Git Usage & Version Control  
âœ” Git was used throughout the development.  
âœ” Two branches were maintained:  
  - `main` â€“ production-ready version  
  - `development` â€“ active development  
âœ” Frequent, meaningful commit messages were written as if working in a collaborative team.  
âœ” The **first commit** contains an empty Unity project, marking the beginning of the work.

## ðŸ§ª Scope & Stability

- ðŸ’¡ Focused solely on gameplay mechanics (menu system included but minimal).  
- ðŸ’¯ Game runs with **zero errors, warnings, or crashes** in both desktop and mobile builds.  
- âœ” Fully tested on Android and desktop platforms.  
- ðŸ§© The codebase is modular, scalable, and easy to extend (e.g., with cloud save support or new layouts).

---

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- Flip cards to find matching pairs.  
- Matched cards stay flipped; mismatched cards flip back after a short delay.  
- Try to match all pairs with the fewest attempts and the highest combo!

---

## ðŸš€ Build Targets

- âœ… Windows/Mac  
- âœ… Android *(iOS compatible in theory, but not tested due to submission scope)*

---

## ðŸ“Œ Final Notes

- Clean, readable code.  
- Strong focus on architecture and separation of concerns.  
- Game flow is designed to be extendable â€” from UI expansion to analytics or advanced save mechanisms.
